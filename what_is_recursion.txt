Recursion Function:

A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesnâ€™t. And this technique is called recursion.

Suppose that you have a function called recurse(). The recurse() is a recursive function if it calls itself inside its body, like this:

function recurse() {
    // ...
    recurse();
    // ...
}

Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself. Otherwise, it will call itself indefinitely.
